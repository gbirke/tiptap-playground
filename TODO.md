## Next steps

- [X] Replace starter-kit with my subset of features: headings, lists,
	paragraphs, links, hr, bold, italic, blockquote
- [ ] Add prettier
- [ ] Try out mentions:
  - Can they be made clickable?
  - Can they become `a` instead of `span`, with href?
- [ ] Test driven development of Prosemirror-JSON-to-markdown renderer and
	JSON-to-Markdown-to-HTML-to-JSON roundtrip.
	Check Prosemirror Markdown serializer for inspiration. Add Markdown-it
	for rendering HTML again. Special rendering for mentions?
